# My love for innovation, cryptocurrencies and community.

Landswap was just a fun project that i use to start to learn more about ethereum, solidity and building application on Web3 World.

I wanted to build a platform what should be fun and a place where people all around the world meet to talk about ideas, trade and support global projects.
